-- Operational Monitoring and Brain Health Views
-- Provides SQL views for monitoring source volumes, enrichment gaps,
-- ingestion pipeline health, entity extraction queue, and graph coverage.
-- Safe to run multiple times (CREATE OR REPLACE).
--
-- Required: Enhanced thoughts schema (schemas/enhanced-thoughts)
-- Optional: Smart ingest schema (schemas/smart-ingest) for the ingestion summary view
-- Optional: Entity extraction schema (schemas/entity-extraction) for queue and
--           graph coverage views
-- Views 6-8 are wrapped in `to_regclass` guards, so running this file on a
-- stock install (only enhanced-thoughts) creates views 1-5 cleanly and emits
-- a NOTICE for each skipped optional view.

-- ============================================================
-- 1. SOURCE VOLUME (24h)
--    How many thoughts arrived from each source in the last day.
--    Quick pulse check — if a source goes silent, investigate.
-- ============================================================

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.ops_source_volume_24h AS
SELECT
  coalesce(source_type, 'unknown') AS source,
  count(*)::bigint AS thoughts_24h
FROM public.thoughts
WHERE created_at >= now() - interval '24 hours'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY thoughts_24h DESC;

-- ============================================================
-- 2. RECENT THOUGHTS WITH SOURCE
--    Last N thoughts with source, type, topics, and preview.
--    Useful for spot-checking what's flowing in.
-- ============================================================

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.ops_recent_thoughts AS
SELECT
  id,
  created_at,
  coalesce(type, 'unknown') AS type,
  coalesce(source_type, 'unknown') AS source,
  importance,
  sensitivity_tier,
  enriched,
  left(content, 180) AS preview
FROM public.thoughts
WHERE sensitivity_tier IS DISTINCT FROM 'restricted'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- ============================================================
-- 3. ENRICHMENT GAPS
--    Thoughts that haven't been enriched yet. If this grows,
--    the enrichment pipeline may be stalled or misconfigured.
-- ============================================================

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.ops_enrichment_gaps AS
SELECT
  id,
  created_at,
  coalesce(type, 'unknown') AS type,
  coalesce(source_type, 'unknown') AS source,
  left(content, 180) AS preview
FROM public.thoughts
WHERE enriched IS NOT TRUE
  AND sensitivity_tier IS DISTINCT FROM 'restricted'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- ============================================================
-- 4. TYPE DISTRIBUTION
--    How thoughts are distributed across types.
--    Helps spot classification drift or misconfigured sources.
-- ============================================================

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.ops_type_distribution AS
SELECT
  coalesce(type, 'unclassified') AS type,
  count(*)::bigint AS total,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at >= now() - interval '7 days')::bigint AS last_7d,

FROM public.thoughts
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY total DESC;

-- ============================================================
-- 5. SENSITIVITY DISTRIBUTION
--    How thoughts break down by sensitivity tier.
--    A sudden spike in "restricted" warrants investigation.
-- ============================================================

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.ops_sensitivity_distribution AS
SELECT
  coalesce(sensitivity_tier, 'standard') AS tier,
  count(*)::bigint AS total
FROM public.thoughts
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY total DESC;

-- ============================================================
-- 6. INGESTION JOB SUMMARY (requires smart-ingest schema)
--    Status breakdown of ingestion jobs. Healthy brains should
--    show mostly "complete" with few "failed".
--    Guarded: only installed if public.ingestion_jobs exists.
-- ============================================================

-- 7. STALLED ENTITY QUEUE (requires entity-extraction schema)
--    Queue items stuck in "processing" for more than 10 minutes,

-- 8. GRAPH COVERAGE (requires entity-extraction schema)
--    How many thoughts have been processed for entity extraction
--    vs how many are still pending.
--    Guarded: only installed if public.entity_extraction_queue exists.

-- 9. GRANTS (for always-installed views 1-5)
--    Views 6-8 are granted inside their guarded DO blocks above
--    so grants only run when the view was actually created.
