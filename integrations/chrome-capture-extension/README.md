> Chrome MV3 extension that captures conversations from Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini into your Open Brain via the REST API gateway.

## What It Does

A client-side Chrome (or Chromium-based browser) extension that sits on top of Claude.ai, chatgpt.com, and gemini.google.com. When you finish an interesting exchange, click the extension icon and the extension extracts the latest user + assistant turn from the page DOM, runs local sensitivity and duplicate filters, and POSTs the result to your Open Brain REST API gateway. It also supports bulk backfill from Claude and ChatGPT using their internal conversation APIs so you can import your existing chat history in one pass.

This is a **client-side** integration — unlike the other integrations in this repo (Slack, Discord, email capture) which deploy as Supabase Edge Functions, a Chrome extension runs entirely in the user's browser. It does **not** register as an MCP server. All it does is call the REST API gateway's `/ingest` endpoint with standard `x-brain-key` auth. Every user installs it locally against their own Open Brain.

## Screenshots

Placeholder. See [`docs/screenshots/README.md`](docs/screenshots/README.md) for the expected filenames. The four targets are:

- First-run Configure screen (URL + API key entry)
- Popup on a Claude tab with Capture Current Response visible
- Activity log showing a successful capture plus a duplicate/skipped one
- Sync tab with Claude full/incremental sync controls

## Prerequisites

- Working Open Brain setup ([guide](../../docs/01-getting-started.md))
- The [`integrations/open-brain-rest`](../open-brain-rest/) gateway deployed and reachable — the extension POSTs to `/open-brain-rest/ingest` and pings `/open-brain-rest/health`
- An `MCP_ACCESS_KEY` (or equivalent `x-brain-key` token) issued by your Open Brain for this device
- Chrome 120+, or any Chromium-based browser that supports MV3 (Edge 120+, Brave, Arc, Opera)

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository to your machine
2. Open your Chromium-based browser and go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Toggle **Developer mode** on (top-right)
4. Click **Load unpacked** and pick the `integrations/chrome-capture-extension/` folder
5. Pin the extension icon to the toolbar so you can reach it quickly
6. A new tab opens automatically on first install — the Configure Open Brain screen (see below)

## First-Run Config

The extension ships with **no hardcoded server URLs**. On first install it opens `popup/config.html` and asks for two things:

1. **Open Brain REST API URL** — the base URL of your REST API gateway. Examples:
   - Supabase-hosted: `https://your-project-ref.supabase.co/functions/v1`
   - Self-hosted: `https://brain.example.com`
2. **API Key** — the `x-brain-key` (`MCP_ACCESS_KEY`) you configured when deploying the REST API integration

When you click **Save & Grant Permission**, Chrome shows a native permission prompt asking whether the extension may access the specific origin you entered. Approve it. This is a one-time grant — Chrome remembers it and the extension can now talk to your Open Brain without asking again. You can revoke the grant any time from `chrome://extensions → Open Brain Capture → Details → Site access`.

**Storage details:**
- API key → `chrome.storage.local` (per-device only, **never** synced across Chrome profiles)
- API URL (`apiEndpoint`) → `chrome.storage.local` (per-device only). Rationale: the URL alone isn't a secret, but combining it with your Google-account-wide synced profiles would let anyone signed into the same Google account on a shared or loaner laptop see a pre-filled target for your Open Brain. Treating the endpoint as per-device avoids that surface, and also sidesteps `chrome.storage.sync`'s 8KB-per-item quota, which could silently reject saves for very long URLs.
- Platform toggles (ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini) → `chrome.storage.sync` (follows your Google account across devices). If `chrome.storage.sync` is unavailable (policy-managed profile, sync disabled, or quota exceeded) the extension transparently falls back to `chrome.storage.local` so saves never silently fail.

## Usage

**Manual capture (primary workflow):**

1. Open a conversation on Claude.ai, chatgpt.com, or gemini.google.com
2. Click the extension icon in the toolbar
3. Click **Capture Current Response**
4. Watch the Activity log on the Overview tab — you should see `captured` and the sent counter tick up
5. Confirm the thought arrived in your Open Brain (query `search_thoughts` or peek at your database's `thoughts` table)

**Bulk backfill (Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini):**

Switch to the Sync tab and click **Sync All** under the platform you want to import. For Claude and ChatGPT the extension walks each platform's internal conversation API using your existing logged-in session; for Gemini it uses a `chrome.debugger`-based history capture (see "Gemini bulk history sync (Phase B/C)" below). Every path funnels through the same ingest pipeline, and dedup is handled via SHA-256 content fingerprints — running Sync All twice is safe. Incremental **Sync New** imports only conversations not yet captured. Optionally turn on **Auto-sync** to keep new conversations flowing in hands-free (15 min cadence for Claude/ChatGPT, 4 h for Gemini).

## Supported Sites

| Site | Manual capture | Bulk sync | Notes |
|------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| `claude.ai` | Yes | Yes | Uses Claude's internal `/api/organizations/.../chat_conversations` endpoint for bulk sync. DOM extractor walks open shadow roots to survive UI refactors. |
| `chatgpt.com`, `chat.openai.com` | Yes | Yes | Uses ChatGPT's `/backend-api/conversations` for bulk sync and `data-message-author-role` selectors for manual capture. |
| `gemini.google.com` | Yes (best-effort) | Yes (debugger-based) | Google exposes no public conversation API, so bulk sync uses `chrome.debugger` to observe Gemini's internal `batchexecute` history-load RPC (`rpcids=hNvQHb`). The "Debugging this browser" banner appears while syncing — see the Gemini bulk history sync section below. Manual-capture selectors target `<user-query>` and `<model-response>` Web Components and may drift with Google UI refreshes. |

## Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ claude.ai / chatgpt.com  │
│ / gemini.google.com tab  │
└──────────┬───────────────┘
           │ content script (bridge.js + extractor-<platform>.js)
           │ extracts last user+assistant turn from DOM
           ▼
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ background/service-      │
│ worker.js                │
│  - sensitivity filter    │
│  - SHA-256 fingerprint   │
│  - retry queue (5 tries, │
│    exponential backoff)  │
└──────────┬───────────────┘
           │ fetch() with x-brain-key header
           ▼
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Open Brain REST API      │
│ /open-brain-rest/ingest  │
│ (Supabase Edge Function) │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

The service worker is the only network caller. Content scripts never touch the network — they only extract DOM text and hand it over via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`. This keeps the API key out of every page's origin and makes the permission model reviewable.

## Gemini bulk history sync (Phase B/C)

Google does not expose a public conversation API for Gemini, so bulk backfill uses a two-part flow that observes Gemini's own internal traffic instead of scraping the DOM.

**Phase B — chrome.debugger history capture.** When a Gemini tab is open, the extension attaches the MV3 debugger protocol (`chrome.debugger.attach`) and watches `Network.requestWillBeSent`/`loadingFinished` for exactly one URL pattern: `batchexecute` requests with `rpcids=hNvQHb` (Gemini's history-load RPC). Other batchexecute rpcids (`MaZiqc`, `ESY5D`, `L5adhe`, and so on — sidebar, settings, status) are ignored. On `loadingFinished` the service worker fetches the response body via `Network.getResponseBody`, parses the framed positional JSON, and funnels every user+assistant turn in the conversation through the existing capture pipeline (retry queue, sensitivity filter, fingerprint dedup, session metrics). No DOM scraping, no parallel `/ingest` path.

**Phase C — Sync All orchestrator.** The Sync tab exposes three Gemini controls:

- **Sync All History** — enumerates every conversation link in your Gemini sidebar (scrolling to load the full list), opens a dedicated background tab, and drives it through each conversation one at a time. Phase B observes the history-load RPC that Gemini fires on page load and resolves a per-conversation waiter. Fingerprint dedup guarantees that re-running Sync All is safe — already-captured turns return `duplicate_fingerprint` / `existing`.
- **Sync New** — same enumeration, but filters against a lifetime list of synced conversation IDs so only conversations you've never captured get navigated. Safe for scheduled use.
- **Auto-sync every 4 hours** — optional. When on, a `chrome.alarms`-driven 4h cadence calls Sync New (capped at 20 conversations per cycle) so new Gemini conversations land in your Open Brain hands-free. Off by default.

A per-conversation jittered throttle (4–12 s plus a longer "reading pause" every 10 conversations) keeps cadence off Google's bot-detection radar. If Gemini does redirect the sync tab to a CAPTCHA/login page mid-run, the orchestrator detects the unhealthy tab, transitions to a `canceled` paused state, and the Sync All button relabels itself to **Resume Sync**. Solve the challenge in the Gemini tab, then click Resume to pick up where the run left off.

**What this requires at install time:**

- Extra manifest permissions: `debugger` (to attach to Gemini tabs) and `scripting` (to run the sidebar-enumeration helper). Chrome shows a combined permission prompt on install / update — "Read and change your data on gemini.google.com" plus "Debug" language. That is expected.
- A visible banner while syncing: Chrome shows "Open Brain Capture started debugging this browser" along the top of Chrome whenever `chrome.debugger` is attached. This is mandatory platform UX — dismissing it cancels the debugger session and the extension will flip to the paused state. Leave it open while Sync All is running.
- No external telemetry, no third-party hosts. Every request that leaves your browser still goes only to your configured Open Brain REST API URL.

**Why use `chrome.debugger` instead of a content script.** Content scripts can't observe cross-origin response bodies. The Gemini history-load payload is a framed positional-array blob that mixes anti-XSSI prefixes with length-prefixed JSON chunks — parsing it from a `fetch()` interceptor in page context would be fragile and require re-implementing half of Google's `batchexecute` protocol in the page. The debugger path gets the raw response bytes exactly as Gemini's own JS receives them.

**Turn off:** set the Gemini toggle to off in Settings, and the debugger detaches from every open Gemini tab immediately. Uninstalling the extension clears all persisted state (sync state, fingerprint cache, retry queue) with it.

## Host Permissions Approach

This extension uses **`optional_host_permissions` + runtime `chrome.permissions.request()`**, not `<all_urls>` at install time. Trade-off analysis:

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| `host_permissions: ["<all_urls>"]` | One-line manifest, no prompt flow | Chrome Web Store flags it as a high-risk permission, install-time prompt scares users, extension can hit any site |
| `optional_host_permissions` + runtime request (chosen) | Minimum-viable permissions, user sees exactly which origin they're granting, survives Chrome Web Store review | Requires a Configure screen + one extra click during setup |

The extension declares `optional_host_permissions: ["https://*/*", "http://localhost/*", "http://127.0.0.1/*"]` in the manifest — the HTTPS wildcard covers public deployments, and the two loopback HTTP entries exist so local dev setups (e.g. `http://localhost:54321`) work without dropping TLS requirements for everyone else. On the Configure screen the extension parses the user's URL, derives an origin pattern like `https://your-project-ref.supabase.co/*`, and calls `chrome.permissions.request({ origins: [origin] })`. The user approves once; Chrome persists the grant; the service worker can now `fetch()` that origin. Nothing else.

The `content_scripts` entries for `claude.ai`, `chatgpt.com`, and `gemini.google.com` remain as normal `host_permissions` because the content scripts inject at `document_idle` on page load — they can't wait for a runtime prompt. Those three origins are scoped narrowly and visible in the install dialog.

## Security

- **API key storage.** The `x-brain-key` lives in `chrome.storage.local`. Chrome encrypts local storage on disk with OS-level keys, and the key is **never** written to `chrome.storage.sync` — meaning it does not propagate to your other Chrome profiles on the same Google account. Rotate by reopening the Configure screen and saving a new value. Uninstalling the extension removes the key along with it.
- **API URL storage.** The Open Brain API URL (`apiEndpoint`) also lives in `chrome.storage.local` only, alongside the key. The URL itself isn't a secret, but sync-replicating it would leak your brain's location to any Chrome profile signed into the same Google account (shared laptops, family devices, loaner Chromebooks). Keeping the endpoint per-device avoids that pre-fill attack surface.
- **Transport security.** The Configure screen rejects any API URL that isn't `https://…` or `http://localhost` / `http://127.0.0.1` (with optional port). The manifest's `optional_host_permissions` reflects the same policy: `https://*/*` plus narrow loopback exceptions only. Plaintext `http://` endpoints over the public internet are not accepted — the `x-brain-key` header and captured conversation text would travel in the clear.
- **Client-side sensitivity filtering.** `data/sensitivity-patterns.json` holds regex patterns for SSNs, passports, bank accounts, API keys, credit cards, passwords-in-URLs, and medical/financial markers. Anything matching a `restricted` pattern is blocked locally before the request is even built — the text never leaves the browser, and the activity log shows a `restricted_blocked` entry. `personal` matches pass through silently and are NOT logged — the intent is to capture them alongside the rest of the conversation, not to separately surface them. Patterns compile once per session and are tested with `String.prototype.match` regex semantics.
- **Outbound requests.** Only the service worker calls `fetch()`, and only to the user-configured origin. No telemetry, no analytics, no third-party hosts.
- **Retry queue integrity.** Failed captures live in `chrome.storage.local` with the full payload and a `nextRetryAt` timestamp. Retries honour exponential backoff (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 minutes, capped at 60), max 5 attempts, then a dead-letter entry in the activity log. Fingerprints live across retries so a retry-then-manual-retry doesn't produce duplicates in Open Brain.
- **CSP.** Manifest V3 service workers run under a strict CSP that forbids `eval` and remote script loading. The lib scripts are all local.

## Publishing to Chrome Web Store

**Status: future work.** This contribution is currently distributed as an unpacked/developer-mode install. To publish to the Chrome Web Store, a maintainer will need to:

1. Review the bundled branded icon set (16/32/48/128 PNGs in [`icons/`](icons/)) and refresh the artwork if needed for a 1.0.0 store listing
2. Fill in the store listing: description, category (Productivity), screenshots, privacy policy URL
3. Draft the **permission justifications** — the store review team requires a paragraph per declared permission. Suggested text:
   - `storage` — "Persists user-supplied Open Brain API URL, API key, and per-platform capture toggles."
   - `alarms` — "Scheduled retry of failed ingests and optional auto-sync from Claude/ChatGPT (15 min) and Gemini (4 hours)."
   - `activeTab`, `tabs` — "Resolves the active conversation tab when the user clicks Capture and creates a transient background tab to drive Gemini bulk sync."
   - `cookies` — "Reads the `lastActiveOrg` cookie on claude.ai and the session cookie on chatgpt.com to bulk-fetch conversations via each platform's internal API using the user's own session."
   - `debugger` — "Attaches the debugger protocol to gemini.google.com tabs only, and only to observe the one internal history-load RPC (`batchexecute` with `rpcids=hNvQHb`) that Gemini itself calls to load conversation turns. No injected code, no DOM modification, no other origins."
   - `scripting` — "Runs a single sidebar-enumeration helper in the Gemini tab to collect conversation IDs for bulk sync. The helper only reads `a[href*=\"/app/\"]` anchors; it does not mutate the page."
   - Host permissions for `claude.ai`, `chatgpt.com`, `chat.openai.com`, `gemini.google.com` — "Content scripts extract the latest conversation turn from the page DOM when the user clicks Capture."
   - `optional_host_permissions` — "Runtime-granted by the user to reach their specific Open Brain API URL."
4. Pay the $5 one-time developer registration fee
5. Submit for review (typically 3–7 business days)

Alternatively, host the packed `.crx` on a maintainer-owned update URL and let users sideload without going through the store at all.

## Known Limitations

- **ChatGPT and Gemini extractors are best-effort and unverified against live pages.** The ChatGPT and Gemini DOM extractors were written from public selector knowledge (`[data-message-author-role]`, `<user-query>` / `<model-response>` Web Components, aria-label fallbacks) and have not been exhaustively verified on a live logged-in session at merge time. They may break with any vendor UI refresh — OpenAI and Google both ship Gemini/ChatGPT UI changes on short cadence. When they break, manual capture on those platforms will return "No conversation turns found" until a maintainer updates the selectors. The Claude manual-capture extractor walks open shadow roots and has been exercised against live claude.ai; it is more resilient. Bulk sync (Claude + ChatGPT) uses internal JSON APIs and is far less fragile than any DOM path.
- **Bulk sync depends on vendor-internal APIs that are not publicly supported.** Anthropic's `/api/organizations/.../chat_conversations` and OpenAI's `/backend-api/conversations` endpoints are undocumented and subject to change without notice. Expect periodic maintenance PRs. If you rely on auto-sync, monitor the Sync Log tab for sustained errors.
- **DOM extraction is fragile.** Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini all ship UI rewrites without notice. When a platform shuffles its selectors, manual capture returns "No conversation turns found" until the extractor is updated. The Gemini extractor is especially exposed — Google ships new Gemini UIs every few months. Expect occasional maintenance PRs. Bulk sync (Claude + ChatGPT) uses stable internal JSON APIs and is far less fragile than DOM extraction.
- **No passive/ambient capture.** The extension only captures when the user explicitly clicks Capture or runs Sync. A previous "observe every turn" design was retired because keeping up with selector churn on every render was not sustainable. The Settings panel has no Auto/Manual capture-mode toggle — that UI was dropped in the initial public release because it controlled only the ambient path. If ambient capture ever ships, the toggle comes back with it.
- **Gemini bulk sync relies on the debugger protocol.** Google does not expose a public conversation history API. The extension observes Gemini's own internal `batchexecute` history-load RPC via `chrome.debugger`, which requires Chrome to show the "Open Brain Capture started debugging this browser" banner while a run is live — dismissing the banner detaches the debugger and pauses the sync. See "Gemini bulk history sync (Phase B/C)" for the full flow.
- **Large conversations.** The REST API `/ingest` endpoint accepts a single payload per request. A 400-turn Claude thread becomes one very large POST. If your gateway has a request size cap (Supabase default is 10MB), Sync All may dead-letter the longest conversations. Check the activity log and trim in your dashboard if that happens.
- **Sensitivity filter is regex-only.** It's deliberately conservative — false negatives are possible. Treat it as a guardrail, not a vault. For truly sensitive content, don't paste it into an AI chat in the first place.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Extension icon has a yellow `!` badge and captures fail**
Solution: The extension is not configured. Click the icon, then click **Open Configure screen** in the yellow banner, and supply your Open Brain REST API URL + API key.

**Issue: "Missing x-brain-key API key" error when I click Capture**
Solution: Either the API key was never saved, or Chrome's local storage got cleared (this can happen after a browser profile reset). Open the Settings tab → **Reconfigure API URL & Key** and re-enter.

**Issue: "Cannot reach the page" error when capturing**
Solution: The content script isn't loaded on this tab. Refresh the tab and retry. If the page is still on the same URL family that the manifest declares (`claude.ai/*`, `chatgpt.com/*`, etc.), the refresh will re-inject the script. If the error persists, disable and re-enable the extension from `chrome://extensions`.

**Issue: "No conversation turns found" on Claude / ChatGPT / Gemini**
Solution: The site DOM has changed and the extractor selectors are stale. Check the repo for a newer version of the extension; if there isn't one yet, open an issue with a sample of the current DOM and the `chrome://extensions → errors` output.

**Issue: Sync All reports every conversation as `existing` but your Open Brain is empty**
Solution: The SHA-256 fingerprint cache is populated but the ingest POSTs are silently rejected. Open the Activity log on the Overview tab and look for `queued_retry` or `dead_letter` entries — those will show the actual API error. Common cause: the REST API gateway is deployed but `MCP_ACCESS_KEY` was rotated and you didn't update the extension.

**Issue: I configured the extension but Test Connection says "fetch failed"**
Solution: Your browser doesn't have host permission for that origin. Open the Configure screen and save again — Chrome will re-prompt. If it still fails, verify the URL is reachable from your browser (paste it directly into the address bar, expect a 401 or similar from the gateway).

## Tool Surface Area

This integration is a **capture source**, not an MCP server — it doesn't expose any tools to your AI. It only writes into Open Brain. The AI-facing tool count of your setup is unchanged by installing this extension.

If you're weighing whether to add more MCP-exposing extensions on top, see the [MCP Tool Audit & Optimization Guide](../../docs/05-tool-audit.md) for how to keep your tool count manageable as your Open Brain grows.

## Changelog

- **0.5.1** — Added the branded icon set (16/32/48/128 PNGs); the toolbar button now shows the Open Brain mark instead of Chrome's default puzzle-piece glyph.
- **0.5.0** — Gemini bulk history sync, host-permission hardening, error surfacing, fingerprint dedup, retry caps, and race fixes.
