## What It Does

This Edge Function exposes the v1 OB1 Agent Memory contract. OpenClaw is the first launch runtime, but these endpoints are runtime-neutral and can be used by Codex, Claude Code, local agents, n8n, or future SQLite adapters.

## Prerequisites

- Working Open Brain setup ([guide](../../docs/01-getting-started.md))
- [`schemas/agent-memory`](../../schemas/agent-memory/) applied
- Supabase CLI installed
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `MCP_ACCESS_KEY` configured as Supabase secrets

## Steps

![Step 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Step_1-Install_the_Schema-1E88E5?style=for-the-badge)

Apply [`schemas/agent-memory/schema.sql`](../../schemas/agent-memory/schema.sql).

**Done when:** the `agent_memories` and `agent_memory_recall_traces` tables exist.

![Step 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Step_2-Deploy_the_Edge_Function-1E88E5?style=for-the-badge)

Copy this folder into your Supabase project:

```bash
supabase functions new agent-memory-api
cp integrations/agent-memory-api/index.ts supabase/functions/agent-memory-api/index.ts
cp integrations/agent-memory-api/deno.json supabase/functions/agent-memory-api/deno.json
supabase functions deploy agent-memory-api --no-verify-jwt
```

**Done when:** `supabase functions list` shows `agent-memory-api` as active.

![Step 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Step_3-Test_Health-1E88E5?style=for-the-badge)

```bash
curl "https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/agent-memory-api/health?key=YOUR_MCP_ACCESS_KEY"
```

**Done when:** the response includes `"ok": true`.

## API Surface

The API accepts the runtime-neutral core schema versions and the OpenClaw launch aliases:

| Contract | Runtime-Neutral | OpenClaw Alias |
| -------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Recall request | `openbrain.agent_memory.recall.v1` | `openbrain.openclaw.recall.v1` |
| Recall response | `openbrain.agent_memory.recall_response.v1` | `openbrain.openclaw.recall_response.v1` |
| Write-back request | `openbrain.agent_memory.writeback.v1` | `openbrain.openclaw.writeback.v1` |
| Write-back response | `openbrain.agent_memory.writeback_response.v1` | `openbrain.openclaw.writeback_response.v1` |

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/health` | GET | Verify deployment |
| `/recall` | POST | Retrieve scoped memories before work starts |
| `/writeback` | POST | Save compact operational memory after work finishes |
| `/recall/:request_id/usage` | POST | Report which recalled memories were used or ignored |
| `/memories` | GET | List memories by workspace, project, status, runtime, type, or task prefix |
| `/memories/review` | GET | List pending agent-written memories |
| `/memories/:id` | GET | Inspect one memory with source/artifact details |
| `/memories/:id/review` | PATCH | Confirm, edit, reject, restrict, stale, dispute, or supersede |
| `/recall-traces/:request_id` | GET | Debug what was recalled and how it was used |

## Expected Outcome

An agent runtime can recall relevant context, write back compact memories, and leave a trace that explains what happened. Unsafe write-backs are blocked before durable storage.

The trust model is documented in [Safe Agent Memory and Provenance](../../docs/safe-agent-memory-provenance.md).

## Smoke Harness

Use the live smoke harness after deploying the Edge Function or rotating secrets:

```bash
OB1_AGENT_MEMORY_ENDPOINT="https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/agent-memory-api" \
OB1_AGENT_MEMORY_KEY="YOUR_MCP_ACCESS_KEY" \
OB1_AGENT_MEMORY_WORKSPACE_ID="ob1-staging" \
OB1_AGENT_MEMORY_PROJECT_ID="agent-memory-api-smoke" \
node integrations/agent-memory-api/smoke/live-smoke.mjs
```

The harness checks health, write-back policy defaults, conservative recall gating, include-unconfirmed recall, usage reporting, review action, memory inspection, recall trace, and unsafe write-back blocking. It prints a JSON summary and never prints the access key.

For personal databases, use the cleanup harness to find or reject smoke/test memories without deleting rows:

```bash
OB1_AGENT_MEMORY_ENDPOINT="https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/agent-memory-api" \
OB1_AGENT_MEMORY_KEY="YOUR_MCP_ACCESS_KEY" \
OB1_AGENT_MEMORY_WORKSPACE_ID="ob1-staging" \
OB1_AGENT_MEMORY_TEST_PROJECT_IDS="agent-memory-api-smoke,agent-memory-openclaw-smoke" \
node integrations/agent-memory-api/smoke/cleanup-test-memory.mjs
```

The default mode is dry-run. Add `--apply` to mark matching active test memories as `rejected`. The harness refuses project IDs that do not look like smoke/test/sandbox scopes.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: `Invalid or missing access key`**
Solution: Confirm the request includes `?key=...` or `x-brain-key`.

**Issue: recall returns no memories**
Solution: Confirm write-back has created `agent_memories`, and that those memories are confirmed or `include_unconfirmed` is true.

**Issue: write-back blocked as unsafe**
Solution: Store a compact summary and artifact links. Do not submit raw transcripts, reasoning traces, secrets, or large code blocks.

## Tool Surface Area

This integration exposes an API that plugins can wrap as tools. See the [MCP Tool Audit & Optimization Guide](../../docs/05-tool-audit.md) before adding additional runtime-specific tool surfaces.
